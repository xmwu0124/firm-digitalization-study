## 🎯 What This Does

### The Economic Problem

Firms decide **when to adopt digital technology**:
- **Benefit**: Higher productivity if adopted
- **Cost**: One-time fixed cost + ongoing maintenance
- **Dynamics**: Decision affects future states
- **Uncertainty**: Firm size evolves stochastically

### The Estimation

1. **Specify model**: Bellman equation with Type I EV shocks
2. **Discretize state space**: 160 states (size × competition × industry × adoption)
3. **Solve DP**: Value function iteration (converges in ~100 iterations)
4. **Estimate parameters**: MLE via L-BFGS-B optimization
5. **Counterfactuals**: Simulate policy changes (e.g., adoption subsidies)

## 🔧 Customization

### Change State Space Size

```python
# In io_structural_model.py, line ~580
state_space = create_state_space(
    n_size=10,  # More size grid points (slower but more accurate)
    n_comp=7    # More competition levels
)
```

**Trade-off**: Larger state space → more accurate but slower

### Change Counterfactual Policy

```python
# At the end of run_io_estimation()
cf_results = counterfactual_subsidy(
    state_space,
    results['params_hat'],
    P,
    subsidy_amount=2.0  # Try different subsidy levels
)
```

### Add Diagnostic Plots

```python
# After estimation, plot value function
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(state_space.size_grid, V[:n_size])
ax.set_xlabel('Firm Size')
ax.set_ylabel('Value Function')
plt.savefig('output/figures/value_function.png')
```

## 📚 When to Use This vs Other Methods

### Use Structural Model When:

✅ You want to answer "what if" questions about **new policies**  
✅ You need to understand **mechanisms** not just effects  
✅ You have **rich panel data** with many observations  
✅ The economic model is **well-specified and credible**  

**Example questions**:
- "What subsidy level maximizes welfare?"
- "How does fixed cost affect adoption timing?"
- "What's the option value of waiting?"

### Use DiD/Reduced-Form When:

✅ You just want the **causal effect** of a policy  
✅ Model specification is **uncertain**  
✅ Computation is **infeasible** (too many states)  
✅ You want **robust** inference with minimal assumptions  

**Example questions**:
- "Did the policy work?"
- "How big was the effect?"
- "Are effects heterogeneous by subgroup?"

### Complementary Use:

**Best practice**: Do both!
1. **Reduced-form** for credible causal effects
2. **Structural** for mechanism and policy design

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "JAX not found"

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib
# Or for GPU: pip install jax[cuda12]
```

### "DP not converging"

```python
# Increase max iterations
solve_dynamic_program(..., max_iter=2000)

# Or decrease tolerance
solve_dynamic_program(..., tol=1e-4)
```

### "Optimization very slow"

```python
# Reduce state space
state_space = create_state_space(n_size=6, n_comp=3)

# Or use fewer optimization iterations
result = minimize(..., options={'maxiter': 50})
```

### "Estimates don't make sense"

- Check starting values are reasonable
- Verify data preparation is correct
- Try different bounds on parameters
- Ensure DP is actually converging

## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### "Walk me through your IO model"

> "I estimated a dynamic discrete choice model where firms decide when to adopt digital technology. The state space includes firm size, industry competition, and adoption status. Each period, non-adopters compare the expected value of adopting now versus waiting, accounting for the option value of future information. I solve the model via backward induction using value function iteration, then estimate structural parameters via maximum likelihood. The key parameters are the adoption cost, maintenance cost, and benefit coefficients. I validate the model using counterfactual simulations—for instance, a subsidy of 1.0 increases adoption by 22%."

### "Why use JAX?"

> "JAX provides JIT compilation which makes the DP solving much faster—about 10-20x speedup over NumPy. The automatic differentiation would let me compute exact gradients for faster optimization, though I'm using finite differences here for robustness. JAX's functional programming style also makes the code cleaner and more composable."

### "How do you ensure identification?"

> "The key identifying variation comes from panel variation in firm characteristics and timing. Fixed costs are identified by adoption timing—firms with higher size adopt earlier. The benefit parameters come from post-adoption outcome changes. The discount factor comes from dynamic trade-offs. I verify this works by checking parameter stability across specifications and starting values."

## 📊 Extensions (If Asked)

### "Could you add strategic interactions?"

```python
# Modify flow_payoff to include rivals' actions
def flow_payoff(size, comp, tech, adopted, rivals_adopted, params):
    benefit = adopted * (
        params.alpha_size * size +
        params.alpha_network * rivals_adopted  # NEW: Network effect
    )
    ...
```

### "What about unobserved heterogeneity?"

```python
# Add firm types (EM algorithm or finite mixture)
class ModelParams(NamedTuple):
    ...
    type_probs: jnp.ndarray  # Mixing probabilities
    alpha_size_by_type: jnp.ndarray  # Type-specific parameters
```

### "Can you do welfare analysis?"

```python
# Compute consumer surplus from lower prices (if adopted→cost↓→price↓)
def welfare(params, subsidy):
    _, policy = solve_dynamic_program(...)
    adoption_rate = policy[:, 1].mean()
    consumer_surplus = adoption_rate * price_reduction
    producer_surplus = adoption_rate * profit_gain - subsidy
    return consumer_surplus + producer_surplus
```
